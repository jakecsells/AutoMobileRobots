{"name":"Auto Mobile Robots","tagline":"Bradley Pearson & Jake Sells","body":"# Overview\r\n***\r\n\r\nWebsite for the submission and hosting of code for [CPE 470: Autonomous Mobile Robots](http://www.cse.unr.edu/~monica/Courses/CPE470-670/index.html) with [Monica Nicolescu](http://www.cse.unr.edu/~monica/). We are using [BricxCC](http://bricxcc.sourceforge.net/) to design, build, and run the programs for the NXT Mindstorm Lego Kit.\r\n\r\n# Lab 2\r\n***\r\n###[Github: Lab 2](https://github.com/jakecsells/AutoMobileRobots/tree/master/Lab02)\r\nThe entire lab can be downloaded from our gibhub page or downloaded from this website. The solution to lab 2 is within the folder \"Lab02\".\r\n\r\nWe successfully completed lab 2 by finishing each mini-program for the lab.\r\n\r\nThe most complex of the programs written is the multi-tasking program. This program required a mutex to control which function has control of the robot at a certain time.\r\n\r\n###Mutex Example:\r\n```c++\r\nmutex control;\r\n...\r\ntask check_sensors()\r\n{\r\n  while (true)\r\n  {\r\n    Acquire(control);\r\n    \r\n    // If left sensor pressed\r\n...\r\n    Release(control);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n...\r\n// Move forward at 50% power\r\ntask move_forward()\r\n{\r\n  while (true)\r\n  {\r\n    Acquire(control);\r\n    OnFwd(OUT_AC, 50);\r\n    Release(control);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Lab 1\r\n***\r\nFor lab one, we built the generic NXT Mindstorm Lego Robot with the kit.\r\n\r\n![Lego NXT Robot](https://raw.github.com/jakecsells/AutoMobileRobots/master/Lab01/mindstorm_nxt_design.jpg)\r\n\r\nPictured is not a picture of our robot, but a picture of the design that we used.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
